&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cappriccio&lt;/strong&gt; is an iOS app I designed and developed to help piano players structure and track their daily practice sessions for maximum improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;-problem&#34;&gt;üìù Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-my-role&#34;&gt;üí° My Role&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I designed, built, and iterated the full product:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
