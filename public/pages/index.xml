      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m Jacob Case. I am an engineering leader and product manager with a passion for building high-impact products at the intersection of hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past several years, I’ve led cross-functional teams in the design, development, and delivery of embedded systems, connected devices, and full-stack software applications. My experience ranges from architecting embedded Linux platforms and IoT solutions to managing product roadmaps and driving agile development cycles from prototype to production.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
