Hi, I’m Jacob Case. I am an engineering leader and product manager with a passion for building high-impact products at the intersection of hardware and software.

Over the past several years, I’ve led cross-functional teams in the design, development, and delivery of embedded systems, connected devices, and full-stack software applications. My experience ranges from architecting embedded Linux platforms and IoT solutions to managing product roadmaps and driving agile development cycles from prototype to production.

As a product-driven engineer, I thrive on solving complex technical challenges while ensuring that business and user needs are met. I enjoy working closely with engineering, design, and business stakeholders to align vision with execution.

My work philosophy is simple: build products that solve real problems, deliver measurable value, and create a positive experience for the end user.

In my spare time, I enjoy developing personal side projects including mobile apps, hardware dashboards, and custom tools for improving productivity and learning.

**Core skills include:**

- Embedded systems architecture
- Mobile application development (iOS)
- Product lifecycle management
- Cross-functional team leadership
- Agile methodologies
- System integration and testing
